    TITLE  HEGABOX standard input file (no HF)               

   ***************************************************
   * Input file for the (transient) heavy gas        *
   * advection model HEGADAS-T. The file is          *
   * generated by dense cloud dispersion model       *
   * HEGABOX. It incorporates all the                *
   * data generated by HEGABOX together with such    *
   * additional variables and flags needed to        *
   * ensure physical consistency. In addition, the   *
   * file contains variables needed to complete a    *
   * viable input file suitable for submission to    *
   * HEGADAS-T; Such additional data are prefixed    *
   * by an asterisk (*) and should be physically     *
   * and contextually sensible, but may be changed   *
   * at the user's discretion.                     e*

   *  NOTE: This file may be added to by the user.    *
   * None of the data generated by HEGABOX, other     *
   *  than "suggestions" preceded by an asterisk (*)  *
   *    should be altered by the user. The keywords   *
   *      TSTAR, XSTEP, CU, CL, CAMIN can             *
   *    be changed freely. The keyword AVTIMC         *
   *   should be adjusted with due regard to its      *
   *      physical interpretation and meaning.        *
   *    Addition of the above keywords is done by     *
   *   removing the asterisk (*) that preceeds the    *
   *  required keyword and (as needed) changing the   *
   *     suggested values. Alternatively the user     *
   * may construct a modified input file for HEGADAS  *
   * by concatenating this file with a partial input  *
   *   file containing the required additional data.  *
   * The latter procedure is performed automatically  *
   *     when using the system utility HGSYSTEM.BAT.  *
